# Polyglot
Ever wondered if you could put different programs in different languages in the same script? No? Well you actually can, wether you care or not.

The script [`polyglot.c`](polyglot.c) is a simple example of what you can do, combining the languages:
- C
- C++
- Shell
- Python
- Php
- Ruby

In the parts specified by a comment `*language* code` you can put any kind of code in the *language* and, when invoked with that language, only that code will be executed.

A simple test script is given, to run the polyglot script in all the supported languages. Oh and that script is polyglot too (thanks [@EliaScandaletti](https://github.com/EliaScandaletti)).
